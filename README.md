# SteamBonk

A small tool that waits for Steam to show its initial main window and any eventual "Special Offers" popups. It then attempts to close them to the tray and terminates itself shortly afterwards.

This is suitable to run as a startup program on your PC via a shortcut placed in the `shell:startup` folder.
